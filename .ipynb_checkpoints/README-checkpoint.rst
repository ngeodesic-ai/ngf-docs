NGF-Docs: Documentation for NGF, ngeodesic, and micro-lm
========================================================

Welcome to **ngf-docs**, the central documentation hub for the Noetic Geodesic Framework (NGF),
the `ngeodesic` Python package, and the `micro-lm` developer tooling.

📚 About NGF
------------

The **Noetic Geodesic Framework (NGF)** introduces the **Warp–Detect–Denoise (WDD)** pipeline,
a new approach to deterministic AI reasoning. NGF provides a structured way to shape trace manifolds,
separate signal from noise, and enforce reproducibility with abstain guarantees.

NGF powers **micro-LMs** — lightweight, domain-specialized sidecars that run alongside large models
to provide deterministic, auditable reasoning in high-stakes domains like finance, healthcare,
and robotics.

🏛 Projects Covered
-------------------

- **ngf-alpha** → the research birthplace of WDD theory.  
- **ngeodesic** → the production-ready Python package implementing NGF rails.  
- **micro-lm** → developer tooling and SDKs for domain-specific micro-LMs.  

🚀 Getting Started
------------------

The documentation site (ReadTheDocs) covers:

- **Getting Started**: installation, quickstart (Python + CLI).  
- **Concepts**: Micro-LMs, NGF rails, determinism, abstains.  
- **Research**: NGF origins, ngf-alpha experiments, WDD theory.  
- **Framework**: details of the `ngeodesic` package and rails.  
- **Domains**: ARC (reasoning stress test) and DeFi (finance primitives).  
- **Engineering**: repo structure, testing, CLI usage, integration.  
- **Legal**: Apache-2.0 license, associated patents, FAQ.
