Getting Started - Introduction
==============================

Welcome to the **ngeodesic / micro-lm** documentation.

This project brings together three pillars:

- **ngf-alpha** → the research birthplace of Warp–Detect–Denoise (WDD) theory.
- **ngeodesic** → the Python package implementing NGF rails (Stage-11).
- **micro-lm** → lightweight, domain-specialized sidecars built on NGF rails.

Our first pilots are:

- **ARC Micro-LM** → reasoning stress test (Abstraction & Reasoning Corpus).
- **DeFi Micro-LM** → finance primitives with verifiers for safety and risk control.

If you are a researcher, developer, or just curious about deterministic AI reasoning,
this guide will help you get started quickly.
