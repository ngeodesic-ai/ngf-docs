‚ùì FAQ
---------------------------------

**Q: Can I use ngeodesic / micro-lm code in my own research or projects?**  
**A:** Yes. Apache-2.0 grants broad rights for academic, personal, and commercial use,
provided you comply with attribution and license terms.

**Q: Can I modify the code and redistribute it?**  
**A:** Yes. You may fork, extend, or redistribute, provided you keep attribution and
license notices intact.

**Q: Can I build commercial products using this code?**  
**A:** Yes. Apache-2.0 explicitly permits commercial usage. The associated patents are
licensed under Apache-2.0 Section 3, so you are free to practice them within the scope
of this repository.

**Q: Are there restrictions because patents are attached to this code?**  
**A:** Yes. While you receive a royalty-free patent license under Apache-2.0, it is
**conditional**. If you violate license terms (e.g., strip attribution, fail to comply
with notices, or file patent litigation against this project), your patent license
automatically terminates. You also cannot file competing patents on the same inventions
already covered (e.g., WDD, Micro-LM sidecars).

**Q: If the code is licensed under Apache-2.0, why has ngeodesic.ai also filed non-provisional patents?**  
**A:** The patents exist to protect the core inventions (WDD, Micro-LM sidecars,
trace shaping, abstain logic) and prevent misuse.  

**Q: Can I remove or rebrand the WDD (Warp‚ÄìDetect‚ÄìDenoise) IP from the code?**  
**A:** No. WDD is protected by patents filed by ngeodesic.ai. You may use it under the
ngeodesic.ai Apache-2.0 license and associated patent grant, but you cannot strip attribution,
rebrand the invention, or attempt to re-patent it. The license grants open usage rights,
not removal of the underlying IP.

Under the ngeodesic.ai Apache-2.0 license and associated patent grant, anyone may
use the code ‚Äî including for commercial purposes ‚Äî as long as they comply with
attribution and license terms.  

However, these inventions cannot be stripped out, rebranded, or re-patented by
others. The patents ensure that the IP remains linked to ngeodesic.ai, while still
allowing broad open-source use.  

In practice, this means the community can innovate freely, but exclusivity or
integration of this IP into a proprietary stack would require a direct agreement
with ngeodesic.ai.

**Q: Can I repackage the code and close-source it?**  
**A:** You may incorporate it into closed-source systems, but you must comply with
attribution and license obligations.

**Q: Can I claim patent rights over the same inventions (e.g., WDD, Micro-LM)?**  
**A:** No. These concepts are already covered by non-provisional patents filed by
ngeodesic.ai. You cannot file competing patents or claim exclusivity.

**Q: Can I challenge the patents or sue over infringement while still using the code?**  
**A:** No. If you initiate patent litigation alleging that this software infringes,
your Apache-2.0 patent license terminates immediately (defensive termination clause).

‚úÖ Summary
----------

By using this software, you benefit from:

- **Open-source freedom (Apache-2.0).**  
- **Patent protection for core contributions.**  
- **Clear guidelines on permissible and impermissible uses.**

This ensures that both the research and product ecosystems around NGF,
micro-LMs, and DeFiPy can flourish with strong foundations for open innovation
and community adoption.
