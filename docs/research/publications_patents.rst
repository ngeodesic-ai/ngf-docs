Publications / Patents
======================

Overview
--------
The Noetic Geodesic Framework (NGF) and Micro‑LMs are backed by both
**open scientific publications** and **filed patents**. This dual track ensures
that the ideas are citable in academic contexts while also protected as
intellectual property for commercial adoption.

Publications
------------

**Technical Memo (Preliminary)**  
- *Warped Semantic Manifolds: A Geometric Framework for Deterministic AI Reasoning*  
  Ian C. Moore, PhD. August 2025.  
  Introduces the imagery of **Warped Semantic Manifolds**, **Cognition Wells**,
  **Geodesic Traversals**, and **Noetic Singularities**. Claims priority on these
  concepts and motivates their role in deterministic reasoning.  
  DOI: `10.5281/zenodo.16730759 <https://zenodo.org/records/16908227>`_ 【191†memo_v4.pdf】

**Preprint (Stage‑11, Work in Progress)**  
- *Noetic Geodesic Framework: A Geometric Approach to Deterministic AI Reasoning*  
  Ian C. Moore, PhD. August 2025.  
  Describes the canonical **Warp → Detect → Denoise** doctrine at Stage‑11, with
  experiments on Latent‑ARC showing near‑deterministic behavior (100/100 exact,
  hallucination ≈ 0.5%).  
  Provisional patent applications listed.  
  DOI: `10.5281/zenodo.17032117 <https://zenodo.org/records/17032117>`_ 【192†article_v20.pdf】

**Ongoing Work**  
- Expanded NGF article draft (`article_v20.pdf`) consolidates theory, math,
  Stage‑11 specification, and results.  
- Planned submission to arXiv to establish public research record.  

Patents
-------

Non‑provisional patent filings (US) have been submitted by ngeodesic.ai to protect
the NGF/WDD inventions and their applications:

1. **Warp–Detect–Denoise (WDD) Framework for Deterministic AI Reasoning**  
2. **Micro‑LM Sidecar Architecture for Domain‑Specific AI**  
3. **Policy‑Guided Verification for Automated Financial Operations**  
4. **Trace Manifold Shaping and Abstain Logic in Lightweight LMs**  

Provisional Applications (2025):  
- **63/864,726** — NGF for Deterministic AI Reasoning (filed Aug 15, 2025)  
- **63/865,437** — Extended NGF with Code‑Enabled AI Reasoning (filed Aug 17, 2025)  
- **63/871,647** — NGF: Deterministic AI Reasoning via Warped Manifold Energy Wells (filed Aug 28, 2025)  
- **63/872,334** — NGF: Geodesic Parser for Latent Trajectories (filed Aug 28, 2025)  

See the ``PATENTS`` file in this repository for authoritative details.

Summary
-------
- **Academic front:** NGF and Micro‑LMs are documented in public memos and
  preprints (Zenodo, upcoming arXiv).  
- **Legal/IP front:** Core ideas are protected by a series of patents, ensuring
  they remain linked to ngeodesic.ai.  

Together, this ensures **broad visibility** in the research community and
**defensible IP rights** in the commercial ecosystem.
